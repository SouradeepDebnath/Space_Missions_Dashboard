# Space_Missions_Dashboard
I have analyzed all the space missions from 1957 to 2022 and created an interactive dashboard where we can visualize all major KPI's along with exciting charts and graphs related to the space missions.

Data sets- https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?search=space (Please refer to this dataset link for this project if you want to add more of your own.)
I want to thank Maven Analytics for uploading an exciting task along with the dataset.
